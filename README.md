For assessment 2 I used angular framework with bootstrap as css library and jsonplaceholder as fake backend. the fake back-end is the reason why the data is so random that it seems like the page is not working. the reason I chose it is because it is the most realistic fake backend I know. It mimics the actual behaviour of a real API, it supports HTTP Client which is needed in building Web pages and Application. but despite with wrong data I made sure that the response is correct.
